# CreativeZen
A repository for reviving and updating Old Creative Zen Mp3 players, including Touch, Micro, and Vison:M

In November of 2024, I went through the process of updating and replacing the drives on a Creative Zen Micro, a Creative Zen Touch, and a Creative Zen Vision:M. This is a repository of how to do this, files I needed, and the hardware I used.

Most of these files and the info are available elsewhere, but I wanted to put it all in one place.
